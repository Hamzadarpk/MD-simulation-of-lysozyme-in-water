Pre-requisites: You should have Gromacs correctly installed in your system. You can confirm this by entering command below:

gmx pdb2gmx --version (in some cases, replace "gmx" with "gmx_mpi").
The command should give you an output stating the version of Gromacs.

Please put all the files (PDB structure and MDP files) in one directory and then follow the commands step-by-step.
